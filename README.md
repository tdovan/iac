HPE Infrastructure as Code

Tuesday the 30th of January 2018, HPE France invites their customer to a Infrastructure as Code discussion.
During this event, HPE experts provide their point of view and run 3 demos:
- Infra as Code view by VMWare (Cloud Foundation) and vRealize (vRA)
- Infra as Code and its ecosystem, ansible/chef/puppet/terraform/saltstack.
- Infra as Code view by Docker
All demo were based on HPE Synergy, the Composable Infrastructure.

This repo contains everything to reproduce the demo.
